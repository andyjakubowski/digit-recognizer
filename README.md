# Digit Recognizer

A convolutional neural network pre-trained for handwritten digit recognition, running in the browser via [ONNX.js](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxjs).

## Folder structure

[`dist`](dist) is the demo website that runs the model.

[`notebooks`](notebooks) holds my own [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) model that I initially trained, but couldnâ€™t deploy. It also includes the pre-trained model I downloaded from the [ONNX Model Zoo](https://github.com/onnx/models).

## Twitter thread

The goal of this project was to deploy a working machine learning model in five days. I described the details, and my learnings, in this [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/jakubowskiandy/status/1326233668000641024).
